##General Information

###Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Report
[<i class="icon-file"></i> Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B75NvMvOGFhBNV9uTTNoRDJRczg&authuser=0)

This framework provides guidelines for teaching statistics over three statistical maturity levels. It addresses the four major areas of statistics:

- Formulating Questions
- Collecting Data
- Analyzing Data
- Interpreting Results

GAISE was written by the Americal Statistical Association and is intended to supplement the *Principles and Standards for School Mathematics* by the NCTM. It is not exactly equivalent with the AP Statistics standards, but it is complementary.

##Resources and Lessons by Unit

###Chapter 1 & 3

####Statistics as "Data Literacy"
One of the most important aspects of AP Statistics is fostering data and statistical literacy in students. An excellent introduction is [<i class="icon-file"></i> "Statistical Literacy: A Short Introduction"][1] from the creator of the [<i class="icon-link"></i> StatLit][2] website. The UK Parliament published [<i class="icon-file"></i>a guide][3] on spotting improper uses of statistics in news articles.

To emphasize the importance of statistics in everyday life, several areas should be addressed to ensure relevance for all students, regardless of career intent:

- Interpreting statistics in news articles
- Being an informed citizen and voter
- Making informed health care decisions
- Data-based business decisions

Ideally, these areas will be incorporated into the entire statistics course and revisited often. 

In July 2014 NPR did an excellent [<i class="icon-link"></i>news series][4] on how people interpret and make decisions based on probabilities. The BBC's [<i class="icon-link"></i>More or Less: Behind the Stats][5] publishes frequent podcasts about statistics in the media.

The popular book [<i class="icon-link"></i>*How to Lie with Statistics*][6] by Darrell Huff has a lot of entertaining examples of statistics misuse and is a good primer on being a critical consumer of statistics. [<i class="icon-file"></i>Chapter 10][7] is a quick read on "talking back to statistics," or reading the news critically. 

>**Activity**
>Students write about a situation in which statistical literacy would be useful in their specific life. Encourage students to think of something unique to them!

####Census at School
[<i class="icon-link"></i>Census at School][8] is a program from the American Statistical Association that both allows you to collect data from your student to use in instruction and to download random samples from other students across the country. This is great for doing comparisons! Students can either fill out a [<i class="icon-file"></i>paper survey][9] or an [<i class="icon-link"></i>online survey][10] (given a class code). More information on setting up your teacher log in and class codes can be found on the [<i class="icon-link"></i>participant instruction page][11].

>**Important Note**
>No individual or identifiable student data is collected on the survey. 

####Data Types
This is a topic that is more difficult than it first appears! The main difficulty I've encountered in the past is students having trouble reconciling that, when it comes time to visualize or analyze, we often change the data type of the data we're dealing with. I.e., when making histograms out of a data set with continuous variables, we actually transform our data into Ordinal. Recognizing the fluidity of data types is important when it comes to hypothesis testing, as data must sometimes be altered to be applicable to a certain test. 

To make things more complicated, different resources use different data categories. I typically refer to the four categories outlined below, from [<i class="icon-file"></i>"On the Theory of Scales of Measurement"][12] by S.S. Stevens. Note that you can describe a category in terms of the category that preceded it on the table.

|Type   |Description    |Examples|
|------ |---------------|--------|
|Nominal|Data that is simply in the form of a label|Gender, color, sports jersey number, favorite food|
|Ordinal|Data that can be ranked in a systematic way|Likert scales, customer satisfaction, class rank, restaurant or movie ratings, clothing and shoe size|
|Interval|Data that contains meaningful distances between values|Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature, time on a clock, IQ
|Ratio|Data that contains a meaningful zero|Kelvin temperature, periods of time, height, weight|

Data can be either discrete or continuous at any level. E.g., you can have discrete data (like number of whole cookies eaten) at the ratio level, and you occasionally see the argument to treat color on the hex or RGB scale as a continuous variable. Typically, nominal and ordinal data are strictly discrete.  

>**Activity**
>Have students identify the data types of each Census at School question and keep for help with analysis later.

####Anscombe's Quartet
This is a great illustration of why graphing data is such an important part of analysis! [<i class="icon-link"></i>Anscombe's Quartet][13] is a collection of four bivariate data sets that all have the exact same descriptive statistics (i.e., means and variance of both variables, correlation of x and y, and the linear regression). 

When presented with the descriptive statistics, students generally confidently claim that all the data sets are the same. However, [<i class="icon-picture"></i> graphing][14] reveals that the data sets are all extremely different!
